# Machine Learning: Naive Bayes Classifier

Here I have used a 2-class Naive Bayes algorithm with an apriori decision
rule using a multinomial estimation for the classes and a gaussian estimation for the
attributes.
## Description
Given are the two data sets named Example and Gauss2 as tsv (tabular separated values). This program is able to read both 
data sets and treat the first value of each line as the class (A or B). The output of your algorithm is
be a single tsv file per data set, which contains a row for each class. The last (third) row contains the absolute number of misclassifications for the data. So the solution would look exactly like Example_NB_Solution.tsv provided in the repository.
